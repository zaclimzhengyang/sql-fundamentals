-- SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint
-- PRIMARY KEY constraints uniquely identifies each record in a table
-- Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values
-- a table can only have ONE primary key: and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields)
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
-- one Primary Key (PK_PERSON). however, the value of the PK is made up of two columns (ID + LastName)


-- SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
-- FK constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables
-- a FK is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PK in another table
-- the table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table
-- Persons Table
-- PersonID	LastName	FirstName	Age
-- 1	Hansen	Ola	30
-- 2	Svendson	Tove	23
-- 3	Pettersen	Kari	20

-- Orders Table
-- OrderID	OrderNumber	PersonID
-- 1	77895	3
-- 2	44678	3
-- 3	22456	2
-- 4	24562	1

-- 'PersonID' column in the 'Persons' table is the PRIMARY KEY in the 'Persons' table
-- 'PersonID' column in the 'Orders' table is a FOREIGN KEY in the 'Orders' table
-- FK constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the FK column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
-- when defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use this:
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder FOREIGN KEY (PersonID)
    REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);

-- SQL CREATE INDEX Statement
-- the statement is used to create indexes in tables. 
-- indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. the users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches / queries
-- an index works by creating a copy of a portion of the table's data in a separate data structure, which
-- is then sorted and organised to facilitate faster searches. this separate data structure can then be 
-- searched more quickly than the original table data, allowing for faster query processing and better
-- overall performance
-- the benefits of using indexes in SQL include:
-- 	1. improved query performance: with an index, queries can be processed more quickly, 
--		resulting in faster response times for users
--	2. reduced I/O operations: by using an index, the database can often retrieve data from the index
--		itself rather than accessing the entire table, which reduces I/O operations and saves processing time
--	3. increased scalability: as the size of a database grows, indexes can help maintain faster query
--		performance, allowing the database to scale more easily
--
--	steps on creating a new index object on the table column(s) we want to index
--		1. determine which column(s) we want to index
--		2. choose a name for the index
--		3. write the SQL command to create the index, specifying the name of the index, the 
--			name of the table, and the name of the column(s0 to be indexed.
--		4. execute the SQL command to create the index
-- create a table 'Customers'
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(50)
);
-- create index on the 'email' column
CREATE INDEX email_index ON customers (email);
-- query the 'customers' table using the 'email' index
SELECT id, name FROM customers WHERE email = 'john@example.com';
-- MySQL query optimiser will use the index to quickly locate the row that match the WHERE clause, 
-- rather than scanning the entire table. this can greatly improve query performance, especially
-- on large tables with many rows.
-- note: not all queries can benefit from an index, and in some cases, using an index may actually slow
-- down the query. the MySQL query optimiser will automatically decide whether to use an index based on factors
-- such as the size of the table, the selectivity of the indeed column and the complexity of the query
-- there are different types of indexes in MySQL:
--	1. Primary Key Index: 
--	2. Unique Index:
--	3. Full-Text Index:
--	4. Composite Index:
--	5. Spatial Index:
-- and while declaring CREATE INDEX on table and column, we have to specify which type of index we want
-- to create a primary key index on a table in MySQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  ...
);
-- to create a unique index on a table in MySQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column_name data_type,
  UNIQUE (column_name)
);
-- to create a full-text index on a table in MySQL
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
-- to create a composite index on a table in MySQL
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
